# Figure 1   Home vs Away: Actual Win Rate vs Bookmaker Prediction (2020–2025)

 ## What this figure shows?
This figure compares the actual win rates of home and away teams with the implied win probabilities derived from sportsbook odds using five seasons of NFL data from 2020 to 2025.

## Key Findings
	1.	Home-field advantage is real and stable
Over five seasons, home teams won 53.9% of all games, confirming a consistent home-field advantage in the NFL.
	2.	Sportsbooks systematically overestimate home teams
The average implied probability for home teams is 57.2%, which is about 3.3 percentage points higher than the actual observed win rate.
	3.	The sum of implied probabilities exceeds 100%
The total implied probability is 104.0%, which indicates a built-in sportsbook margin of about 4%, also known as the house edge.

## Core Interpretation

Sportsbook odds are not neutral probability estimates.
They are risk-adjusted prices designed to ensure long-term profitability for the bookmaker.


# Figure 2  Are Betting Odds Accurate? (2020–2025)
## What this figure shows?
This figure evaluates the calibration of sportsbook odds using NFL data from 2020–2025.

We group all games into probability bins based on the home team’s implied probability, and for each bin we compare:
	•	The actual win rate
	•	The average implied probability from odds

The black dashed line represents perfect calibration, where prediction equals reality.


## How to interpret the plot
	•	If blue points lie directly on the dashed line, the odds are well-calibrated
	•	If they lie above or below, the sportsbook is over- or under-estimating win probabilities


## Findings from the 5-Year Data:

 1. Sportsbooks are highly accurate in mid-range probabilities (50%–70%)
In this range, actual win rates closely match the implied probabilities.

2. Low-probability home teams are systematically overestimated
When the home team is a strong underdog, sportsbooks tend to assign slightly higher probabilities than reality.

3. Heavy favorites are slightly underestimated
When the home team is an extreme favorite, actual win rates are slightly higher than predicted.

 ## Core Conclusion

Sportsbook odds are generally well calibrated, especially in the mid-probability range, but they show systematic bias at probability extremes.

# Figure 3   Which Bookmaker Gives Best EV? (2020–2025)
 
 ## What this figure shows?
This figure compares the average expected value (EV) of bets across different sportsbooks using five seasons of NFL data from 2020 to 2025.
	The x-axis shows the average EV
	The y-axis lists different bookmakers
	Green bars indicate relatively better EV for bettors
	Red bars indicate consistently negative EV

 ## Key Takeaways
	1.	Not all sportsbooks treat bettors the same mathematically
Some platforms are much more unfavorable than others in the long run.
	2.	Platforms like Betfair and Lowvig show relatively higher EV
This suggests that their odds are:
	-Less heavily margined
	-Or closer to true win probabilities
From a theoretical standpoint, they are more “bettor-friendly”.

	3.	Platforms like FoxBet and PointsBet show clearly negative EV
This means that even with rational betting behavior:

Players are statistically more likely to lose money over time on these platforms.
A higher EV does NOT guarantee real-world profit.

 ## Conclusion

Different sportsbooks vary significantly in how favorable their odds are to bettors, but none offer a reliable path to consistent long-term profit.


# Figure 4   +EV Betting Strategy: Cumulative Profit (2020–2025)

## What this figure shows?
This figure simulates a simple betting strategy:
	Only place a $100 bet when EV > 0
	Based on real NFL games from 2020 to 2025
	More than 12,000 total bets

## Key Results
	Total bets: 12,354
	Win rate: 52.5%
	Final profit: –$16,147 (loss)

## What does this mean?
Even when we only bet on “positive EV” opportunities and win more than half of the time, we still lose money in the long run.

## Why does this happen?

	Odds already include the bookmaker’s margin
	Markets adjust quickly
	Small theoretical advantages disappear over time

Using odds alone is not enough to beat the system.

## Conclusion 

A strategy that looks profitable in theory still loses money in real life when applied at scale
